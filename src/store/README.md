Al Role Playing Conversations - Users engage in spoken or text based conversations with

virtual characters (teacher, boss, customer, Al coach, etc.), where Al corrects grammar in real time and explains mistakes in a fun, engaging way

Grammar Battle Mode - Players challenge Al or friends in real time spelling & grammar correction battles, racing to fix sentences and earn points, badges, and fun Al generated rewards.

seamless bilingual learning.
